Upon his death in 1976, Dr. John Sawhill willed his life's possessions to the James Madison University Foundation. His lifelong collection of 1300 ancient Roman and Greek coins were eventually sold in a landmark 1979 auction which included 265 others owned by President John Quincy Adams and his descendants. Approximately ~450 coins remain within the Madison Art Collection. 

The **Recovering Sawhill Project** honor the legacy fo Drs. John and Bessie Sawhill by utilizing the remaining collection to conduct modern numismatic research in provenance recovery, support undergraduate numismatic internships, and utilize 3D modeling techniques to facilitate exhibits and outreach.
