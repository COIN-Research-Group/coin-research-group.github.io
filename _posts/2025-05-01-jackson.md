    Jackson Greer discussing the problem of coin identification and provenance matching
</div>

Jackson Greer (CS '25) presented his research on deep learning methods for ancient coin identification and historical provenance recovery. His work will assist the Madison Art Collection in recovering lost ownership information from the [Sawhill Ancient Coin Collection](https://www.jmu.edu/madisonart/_coin_collection.shtml). He applied various deep metric learning methods to existing datasets of Roman Republican coins and validated his approach from sample images from the Sawhill collection. His presentation is available online ([PDF](/assets/pdf/greer-deep-metric-learning.pdf)).
