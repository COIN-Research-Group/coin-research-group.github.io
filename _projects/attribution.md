The last inventory of the Sawhill Collection was conducted in 1997 by Alexander Clain-Stefanelli of Lucien Birkler and Company ([PDF](/assets/pdf/sawhill-inventory.pdf)). Since that time many revision have been made to Roman and Greek coinage. Through the support of the JMU Libraries, and under the supervision of the Curator of Coins, several numismatic interns in the Madison Art Collection have worked to revise the collection description and maintain care for the ~450 coins remaining in the collection. 

The most recent updates for [Roman](https://jmu.emuseum.com/advancedsearch/Objects/classifications%3ACurrency%3Binvno%3A2024.1.*%3Bdepartment%3AMadison%20Art%20Collection/images?sort=invno-asc) and [Greek](https://jmu.emuseum.com/advancedsearch/Objects/classifications%3ACurrency%3Binvno%3A2024.2.*%3Bdepartment%3AMadison%20Art%20Collection/images?page=1&sort=invno-asc) coins are available on the [eMuseum site](https://jmu.emuseum.com/collections). Please direct any errors or omissions to the [Curator of Coins](https://www.jmu.edu/madisonart/people/forsyth-jason.shtml)
