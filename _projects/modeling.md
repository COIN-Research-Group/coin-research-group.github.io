When you hold an ancient coin in hand, you experience a powerful and tangible connection to the past. Once you leave the museum, how can you continue that experience, or even continue to interact with these objects in augmented or virtual experiences? Pushing our boundaries even farther, how might persons with limited or low visibility interact with such small and detailed objects?

To address these challenges we are exploring methods to create 3D models of our coins. By examining a variety of methods to capture objects from CAD drawings, AI-enhanced photogrametry, and hand-held 3D scanners we explore how these objects might be replicated in the physical and virtual worlds.
